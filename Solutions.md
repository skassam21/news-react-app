## Application

Our application was built with webpack and Reactjs. Further information about your application can be found on the readme.md

Here are the list of pages of the application:
- First page is the landing page
- After you press `Get Started`, the application takes you through a quiz with three questions to get to know your tastes and interests
- After the quiz, you are shown the new stories that fit your tastes and interests
- Lastly, there is a modal when you click on the icon in the top right corner that lets you choose the new stories you want to see

## Debugging and Testing

For debugging, run:

    ```sh
    npm install
    npm run debug
    ```

Then you can open the webpage `http://localhost:8080` to see the application. Make any changes to the javascript, and the page will automatically reload.

If you add a package to `package.json` make sure to run:

    ```sh
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```

### Test

Open up `index.html` to see the full application after building.
