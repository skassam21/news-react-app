## Application

Our application was built with webpack and Reactjs. Further information about your application can be found on the readme.md

Here are the list of pages:
- First page gets to know your tastes and chooses a bunch of new channels to follow
- Second page shows you the top stories for each news channel - you can sort them, change their order, and filter by channel
- Third page is a settings page that lets you change the channels that you are subscribed to

## Debugging and Testing

For debugging, run:

    ```sh
    npm install
    npm run debug
    ```

Then you can open the webpage `http://localhost:8080` to see the application. Make any changes to the javascript, and the page will automatically reload.

If you add a package to `package.json` make sure to run:
    ```sh
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```

### Test

Open up `index.html` to see the full application after building.
