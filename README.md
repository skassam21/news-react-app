Who We Are
-----------
With the tangle of different news source prevalent in today's media, we feel that it is difficult for one to find the information they want.

As a group of students, we've decided to build this web application to better help individuals explore and analyse a variety of different news mediums that best interests them.

With this in mind, there are **three important principles** our application revolves around.

#### <i class="icon-refresh"></i> Specificity

 Everybody has different likes and interests and this is something we value
 as we want to find you the articles that you most care about in today's world.

#### <i class="icon-pencil"></i> Presentation

Nobody likes a convoluted, ambiguous and hard to read website, so we design our application with the principles in mind that will best fit our user audience.

#### <i class="icon-trash"></i> Reliability
Fake news is a worrying trend in today's society and we want to make sure 
that we only pick and relay to you the most reliable and trusted news sources.
